Feel the Promenade which runs along forest-like vegetation by its side. A Sky Park with a Jogging Track on the 33rd floor, a Sunrise Point, Shops, Cafes, uniquely-designed Club Houses, Gardens on most floors, plenty of Community Spaces, and even a Private Cinema for screening, and much more. Amongst others, there is a Learning Centre open for all age groups. Canâ€™t step out? Download project app and order all essential services from laundry to groceries, with a few touches and swipes. With one or two Bay Windows (many being in the corner) in almost every home, large decks and modular kitchens, Nikoo Homes II represents a great design.
