		  	<div class="card-content">Unlike many in real estate, Bhartiya Group comes from the design background. The company started in 1987 by designing apparel. Soon, designs from our studio in Milan were being adapted by brands like Hugo Boss, Armani, Zara and Mango. During the course of our evolution, we would abide by a simple truth - good design makes people happy. Be it a well-cut, flattering jacket or a thoughtfully built house. To move from one to the other took us two decades. During these years, our founder Snehdeep Aggarwal traveled extensively to the finest cities in the world. There was tremendous contrast between what he saw in Munich, Florence and London with that in Indian cities. Even the common man there could afford a good home. Cycling to work was not life-threatening. If such a life was possible in Amsterdam and Barcelona and Milan, then why not here? For our founder, this was not a rhetorical question. His answer was to build a whole city, to design a whole way of life. That vision is Bhartiya City. The project has brought together architects and urban planners of international repute. including Perkins Eastman - New York, Cox - Sydney, BDP Khandekar - Amsterdam for master planning, Broadway Malayan - Singapore for residential, retail and hotel and Edifice - Mumbai for the IT Park, among others.</div>
