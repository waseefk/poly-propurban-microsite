The ice-cream truck makes its daily rounds here. He’s the guy who knows everyone in the City. And everyone knows him. People cycle to work. They get home early. They choose to catch-up with neighbours on the lawn just outside their homes. Or go shopping down to the high street. Or walk to their favourite watering hole. Sundown. Simple, yes. Idyllic and a little other-worldly, sure. Easy? Certainly not. It’s taken six teams of architects over four years to design this City. Soul upwards. With every detail obsessed over. Down to the curbstones, each one cut identical to the other so that they fit perfectly. It wouldn't be a joyride if the road is bumpy, would it? Furniture crafted in Italy. Street lights that multi-task as surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi ports. It’s a City where the past meets the future and together live happily ever after. This is the City of Joy.</div>
